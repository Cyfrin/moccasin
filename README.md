_You can see how we conducted these tests from the [benchmarking repo](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/benchmarking-frameworks)._

Fast to install, test, and run python commands on your smart contracts.

# Highlights

- üêç Pythonic start to finish, built on top of Vyper's [titanoboa](https://titanoboa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- üîê ZKsync built-in support
- üìë Named Contracts allow you to define smart contract addresses without scaffolding anything yourself
- üß™ Custom staging pytest markers so you can run tests anywhere, anyhow
- ü¶ä Support for encrypting wallets, no private keys in `.env` files! 
- üß≥ GitHub and Python smart contract dependency installation 

# Quickstart

Head over to [the moccasin installation documentation](https://cyfrin.github.io/moccasin/installing_moccasin.html) to for other install methodologies and getting stated.

## This README Quickstart

To install the moccasin `mox` command, we recommend the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) tool.

```bash
uv tool install moccasin --prerelease=allow
```

Then, see a list of commands with:

```bash
mox --help
```

## Background

> Agkistrodon piscivorus is a species of venomous snake, a pit viper in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ·ºÑŒ≥Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑœÅŒøŒΩ agkistron "fish-hook, hook" and ·ΩÄŒ¥œéŒΩ odon "tooth", and the specific name comes from the Latin piscis 'fish' and voro '(I) eat greedily, devour'; thus, the scientific name translates to "hook-toothed fish-eater". Common names include cottonmouth, northern cottonmouth, water moccasin, swamp moccasin, black moccasin, and simply viper.
