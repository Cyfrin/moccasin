_You can see how we conducted these tests from the [benchmarking repo](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/benchmarking-frameworks)._

Fast to install, test, and run python commands on your smart contracts.

## Background

> Agkistrodon piscivorus is a species of venomous snake, a pit viper in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. The generic name is derived from the Greek words ἄγκιστρον agkistron "fish-hook, hook" and ὀδών odon "tooth", and the specific name comes from the Latin piscis 'fish' and voro '(I) eat greedily, devour'; thus, the scientific name translates to "hook-toothed fish-eater". Common names include cottonmouth, northern cottonmouth, water moccasin, swamp moccasin, black moccasin, and simply viper.
