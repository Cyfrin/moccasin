Series 1: Moccasin Core & ZKsync
================================

Now entering to the world of Moccasin!
This will be your first step in learning how to build and
handle smart contracts using Moccasin.

**What's different about the core documentation and this tutorial?**

The core documentation is designed to be a reference
for the Moccasin framework, while this tutorial is designed to be a
step-by-step guide to help you get started with Moccasin and ZKsync Era.
This tutorial will guide you through the process of:

- Setting up your environment
- Writing your first contract
- Deploying it to ZKsync Era locally and on the testnet


ZKsync Era is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that
uses zero-knowledge rollups to provide fast
and low-cost transactions.

See `ZKsync Era documentation <https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era>`_ for more information.

Excited to get started? Let's go!
