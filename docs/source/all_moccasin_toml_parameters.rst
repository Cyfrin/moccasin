All moccasin TOML Parameters
============================

TOML Formatting
---------------

In TOML, you can think of each section as a giant JSON object. Each of these are essentially identical:

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| TOML (Expanded)                  | TOML (Compact)                   | JSON                             |

Environment Variables 
---------------------

Additionally, there are a few environment variables that ``moccasin`` will look for, but it's also okay if they are not set. It's important to note, that the ``.env`` file you set in the config will be ignored for these values. 

.. code-block:: bash 

    MOCCASIN_DEFAULT_FOLDER = "~/.moccasin" # path to the moccasin folder
    MOCCASIN_KEYSTORE_PATH = "~/.moccasin/keystore" # path to the keystore
