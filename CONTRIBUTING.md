- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `just --version` and you see a response like `just 1.35.0`

### ZKSync requirements
If you wish to run the ZKSync tests, you'll need these as well (ran with `just test-z`)

- [era_test_node](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `era_test_node --version` and you see a response like `era_test_node 0.1.0 (a178051e8 2024-09-07)`
- [era-compiler-vyper](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `zkvyper --version` and you see a response like `Vyper compiler for ZKsync v1.5.4 (LLVM build f9f732c8ebdb88fb8cd4528482a00e4f65bcb8b7)`

## Installing for local development 

Follow the steps to clone the repo for you to make changes to this project.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyfrin/moccasin
cd moccasin
```

2. Sync dependencies

*This repo uses uv to manage python dependencies and version. So you don't have to deal with virtual environments (much)*

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

And start making your changes! Once you're done, you can commit your changes and push them to your forked repo.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'your commit message'
git push <your_forked_github>
```

4. Virtual Environment

You can then (optionally) work with the virtual environment created by `uv`.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And to remove the virtual environment, just run:
```bash
deactivate
```

However, if you run tests and scripts using the `uv` or `just` commands as we will describe below, you won't have to worry about that. 

*Note: When you delete your terminal/shell, you will need to reactivate this virtual environment again each time. To exit this python virtual environment, type `deactivate`*

## Running Tests

First, you'll need to make sure you have the `anvil1` keystore in your `~/.moccasin/keystores` folder. You can [find it here](./tests/data/keystores/anvil1). Please move it there. 

### Local Tests

Run the following:

```bash
just test # Check out the justfile to see the command this runs
```
This is equivalent to running `pytest` in the root directory of the project.

### Integration Tests

Read the [README.md in the integration folder](./tests/integration/README.md) to see how to run the integration tests.

```bash
just test-i # Check out the justfile to see the command this runs
```

### ZKSync Tests

These will be the zksync tests that require the [ZKsync requirements](#zksync-requirements) to be installed. 

```bash
just test-z # Check out the justfile to see the command this runs

```

# Code Style Guide

We will run the `.github/workflows` before merging your PR to ensure that your code is up to standard. Be sure to run the scripts in there before submitting a PR.

For type checking:

```bash
just typecheck # Check out the justfile to see the command this runs
```

For code formatting: 

```bash
just format # Check out the justfile to see the command this runs
```

## Where do you get the `typecheck` and `format` command?

You can see in `justfile` a list of scripts one can run. To see them all you can run simply `just`
